# ofxSpreadsheet

Spreadsheet editor for OpenFrameworks.

Forked from [Gene Kogan](https://github.com/genekogan) 

This fork allows you to sort the columns of data either by clicking the headers or using the defined key strokes.

This fork contains two additional examples. One that uses custom data structures as data sources and one that uses CSV to load and save the spreadsheet.
